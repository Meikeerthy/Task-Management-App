# Task-Management-App

A simple task management web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage their tasks. It also supports dynamic navigation between different sections like the home page and task manager using JavaScript.

  - Add tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority.
  - Edit or delete tasks.
  - Mark tasks as completed.
  - Filter tasks based on their status (All, Completed, Pending).
- Dark Mode: Toggle between dark mode and light mode for a better user experience in different lighting conditions.
- Dynamic Navigation: Switch between the Home page and Task Manager using buttons without reloading the page.

Technologies Used
- HTML: Structure and content of the web pages.
- CSS: Styling the app with a light green theme, button styles, and responsive layout.
